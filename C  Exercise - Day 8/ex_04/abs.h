/*Take back your files from previous exercises and modify your function ‘my_init’. It will now take three parameters: the same structure pointer as before, an integer and a char pointer.
The ‘id’ field will be initialized with the number given in parameter. You will apply your ‘MY_ABS’ macro to
this number beforehand.
The ‘str’ field will be a copy of the char pointer in a newly allocated memory space in your function
